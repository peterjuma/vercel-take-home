_As Support Engineers, we sometimes encounter a complex and puzzling technical problem that we can't make heads or tails of. Resolving such a complex technical issue may take several days and open up multiple pathways one of which would inevitably lead to a solution. This blog post describes one such instance where a DNS resolution issue, reported by a customer, created a perfect storm that ended up exposing a critical bug in the Linux kernel._

_Solving such complex issue requires one to not only have the technical knowledge in the field, but also posses critical thinking and problemsolving skills. The author goes on to give us a sneak peak on their troubleshooting philosophy; clearly defining the issue, collecting relevant information, forming a hypothesis,testing the hypothesis, and eventually fixing the problem. Troubleshooting, according to the author, is "both a science and an art"._

_A good day in a Support Engineer's day is a happy ending for the customer, and the thrill of solving a complex issue. This was as good as it gets._
